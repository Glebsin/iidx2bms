**Tested on Windows 11, ffmpeg and Python 3.14.2 should be installed and added to PATH, 1 chart per script launch, probably doesn't work with omnimix charts.**

**Converted charts tested only in [**`LR2oraja Endless Dream`**](https://github.com/seraxis/lr2oraja-endlessdream) and probably working only there (or in common beatoraja too idk)**
